## Overview

MultiModelOptimizer enables efficient joint training of multiple transformer architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, etc.) by implementing:

1. **Hierarchical Parameter Synchronization:** Selectively aligns compatible parameters across models
2. **Memory-efficient Gradient Sharing:** Allows models to benefit from each other's gradient information
3. **Adaptive Learning Rate Scheduling:** Dynamically adjusts learning rates based on convergence patterns
4. **Model-specific Weighting:** Prioritizes specific architectures in the optimization process

## How It Works

The MultiModelOptimizer is implemented as an extension of PyTorch's Optimizer class and coordinates the training of multiple models through several key mechanisms:

1. **Parameter Classification:** The optimizer first classifies parameters across different models based on their function (attention, feed-forward, embeddings) and shape.

2. **Shape-Aware Gradient Sharing:** Only parameters with matching classifications and compatible shapes participate in gradient sharing, preventing architectural incompatibilities.

3. **Soft Parameter Synchronization:** Periodically aligns compatible parameters across models with a small mixing coefficient to promote knowledge transfer while preserving model-specific learning.

4. **Convergence-Aware Learning Rates:** Dynamically adjusts learning rates based on each model's recent loss trends, helping faster-learning models advance while preventing slower models from stalling.

## Why Multi-Agent Alignment Matters

Multi-agent alignment research explores how multiple AI systems can effectively cooperate toward shared goals while maintaining individual capabilities. The MultiModelOptimizer offers valuable insights for this field:

1. **Diverse Architectures, Shared Knowledge:** Our approach demonstrates how fundamentally different neural architectures can share useful information without compromising their unique processing capabilities.

2. **Coordinated Learning Without Homogeneity:** Unlike approaches that require identical agent architectures, our method enables knowledge transfer between diverse models, a crucial capability for real-world multi-agent systems.

3. **Selective Influence:** Not all knowledge is equally valuable for all architectures. Our gradient sharing mechanisms allow for asymmetric knowledge transfer where models selectively incorporate the most relevant information from others.

4. **Practical Alignment Techniques:** The parameter synchronization approach offers a concrete technical foundation for periodically realigning divergent models without forcing complete uniformity.

These insights extend beyond transformer models to broader AI alignment challenges, where diverse cognitive architectures must cooperate effectively while maintaining their specialized capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch loguru numpy transformers datasets
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from multi_model_optimizer import MultiModelOptimizer

# Initialize your models
models = {
    "bert": BertModel(...),
    "gpt2": GPT2Model(...),
    "roberta": RobertaModel(...)
}

# Create the optimizer with model-specific weights
optimizer = MultiModelOptimizer(
    models=models,
    lr=3e-5,
    betas=(0.9, 0.999),
    weight_decay=0.01,
    model_weights={"bert": 1.0, "gpt2": 0.8, "roberta": 1.2},
    gradient_accumulation_steps=2
)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # Zero gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        
        # Forward/backward for each model
        losses = {}
        for model_name, model in models.items():
            outputs = model(**batch)
            loss = outputs.loss
            loss.backward()
            losses[model_name] = loss.item()
        
        # Log metrics
        optimizer.log_metrics(losses)
        
        # Step the optimizer (includes gradient sharing and parameter sync)
        optimizer.step()
```
